# py-calculator
A command-line tool to calculate π (Pi) with high precision.

## Overview
`py-calculator` is a simple command-line tool written in Python that allows users to calculate the value of π (Pi) to a high degree of precision. It uses the Chudnovsky algorithm for fast and efficient computation, making it possible to generate thousands of decimal places of π without external libraries.

## Installation
To install `py-calculator`, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/R-D-Y/py-calculator.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd py-calculator
```

Install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install decimal
```

## Usage
After installing `py-calculator`, you can use it directly from the command line. Simply type `pi.py` for π:

```bash
python3.8.exe .\pi.py
```

For example, to calculate π with 1000 decimal places:




## Explanation
The tool uses the Chudnovsky algorithm, which is known for its rapid convergence, thus allowing for the computation of π with a large number of decimal places in a relatively short time. It utilizes Python's `decimal` module to maintain precision.
